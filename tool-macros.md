While Commands are pretty powerful on their own, having to fill in parameter values multiple times and continually clicking buttons to execute commands can be tedious. To overcome this the edpf offers Macros. The macro tool allows edpf users to execute scripted device IO with any number of commands and delays mixed in. The macro tool also has 2 modes: loop and one shot. The looping mode repeats the script over and over until the user clicks the stop button, while the one shot mode executes the full script one time.

The macro tool is especially useful in combination with the charting and logging tools to generate a lot of data samples over a long period of time.
