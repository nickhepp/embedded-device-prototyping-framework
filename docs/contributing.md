## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

Before you begin:
- Have you read the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/nickhepp/embedded-device-prototyping-framework/issues) .

### Before you make your changes

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/nickhepp/embedded-device-prototyping-framework/issues) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, [open an issue](https://github.com/nickhepp/embedded-device-prototyping-framework/issues/new). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

### Make your update
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.  Test, test, and then test some more :-)

### Unit tests
Are you making changes to the application code? Make sure the unit tests still pass.  Also if doing work of any substance add more unit tests.

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from this project will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a self review.
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The project community thanks you. :sparkles:

## Starting with an issue
You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Reviewing
We review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Review the entire pull request.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
